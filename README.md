Ansible playbooks
by Michael He

I have included two ansible playbooks in this repository.

>1. install-ELK.yml
>2. pentest-DVWA.yml

1. install-ELK.yml provisions an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack web server and interface for centralized log management on a cloud computing platform

2. pentest-DVWA.yml installs the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) on a cloud computing platform for web application security testing
